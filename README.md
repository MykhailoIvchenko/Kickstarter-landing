1. The project implements one-page landing according to given design. It is created to demonstrate HTML and CSS skills.
The landing is adapted for desctop, large screens, mobile and tablet. The smallest screen width is concidered as 320 px. If you use smaller screen,
the page may be not displayed correct.
  The landing is based on such screen sizes:
  - The design 1440px (large screen)
  - Notebook 1280px
  - Tablet 768px
  - Mobile (> 320px)

  In some places falsy links in href are used, because there no pages to visit in this landing (they could be implemented in the whole site). For example, buy button doesn't fulfill any actions. Languages switch is not make any actions. It is only demonstrates the interface changing. There are also no any requests to server after form submitting. Only interaction with user is demonstrated. Java Script was used a little just for making interactive behaviour for some elements, such as button and picture hiding and video playback starting. After video track ending the play button and background picture appears again automatically. Humberger menu was implemented according to idea described here: https://codepen.io/erikterwan/pen/EVzeRP
